Negative Reviews ðŸ˜ 
"Extremely overcrowded and overpriced. Waited in line for 2 hours for a 3-minute ride. Not worth the money or the hassle."

"Disappointing experience. Many rides were closed for maintenance and the staff seemed tired and uninterested. Food was overpriced and mediocre."

"The magic is gone. Too commercialized and crowded. Felt like we were being nickel-and-dimed at every turn. Won't be returning."

"Hot, crowded, and exhausting. The park needs better crowd management and more shade areas. Children were crying everywhere from exhaustion."

"Expected so much more based on the reputation. Long lines, rude guests pushing in queues, and overpriced everything. Not the magical experience we hoped for."

"Some aspects were great like the classic rides, but the crowds really diminish the experience. Would recommend going during off-peak season."

"The park has its magical moments but be prepared to spend a lot of money. The Genie+ system is confusing and adds to the overall cost."

"Beautiful theming and details throughout the park, but the experience is marred by excessive crowds and long wait times for everything."
